			<p>
				Howard Philip Lovecraft was a legendary horror writer. He lived from 
				1890 to 1937. He took inspiration of an other legend in the same 
				domain, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe, and tryed to describe unimaginable 
				horror for all his life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				He mostly wrote novels and eventually gained the public attention. 
				Now he is mostly known for "The call of Cthulhu" but he had a major 
				impact on horror and science-fiction. He is the one who invented the 
				necronomicon and is creatures are still often referenced by modern 
				authors e.g. In Stephen King "Bazard" the main protagoist sees the 
				name of "Yog-Sothoth" written somewhere and while not knowing what 
				it represent, he is overcomed by a feeling of dread and turn back as 
				fast as possible.

				This is the impact of HP Lovecraft!
